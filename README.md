## ❗ App doesn't work anymore ❗
On September 2021 big changes have been done to the gamestop website and now the app is no longer capable to retrieve any kind of information from it.
If you really want to use the app, [here](https://github.com/Brankale/gamestop_website_scraper) you can find the new website parser.
The parser is not updated to support the new changes but you can easily modify it in order to do so, you just need to know a little about HTML, Java and Jsoup.
Then you must update this project and generate a new APK. 

## ⚠ Warnings ⚠ 
- This is NOT an official app
- This app is available for Android 5.0 and above
- Currently ONLY Gamestop italy is supported
- This app uses a html parser hardcoded in the app. The parser was then rewritten as a standalone [project](https://github.com/Brankale/gamestop_website_scraper).

## Features:
- Dark / Light theme
- Supported languages: English / Italian
